## Iteration 3: First Frame — Get VdSwap Called

### Tier 0: CRITICAL PATH — Trace the Present/Swap failure

- [ ] **Find D3DDevice_Present/Swap in MAP and check if called** [analysis]
  - VdSwap is imported but never called during 40s run
  - Need to find the D3D present path: D3DDevice_Present → ... → VdSwap
  - Identify which function in the chain is missing or failing

- [ ] **Investigate frequent `guest 0x00000000` execution** [analysis]
  - Thread 6 JIT IP samples show frequent execution at address 0
  - These are null function pointer calls (stubs)
  - If a critical D3D function resolves to null, that breaks the present pipeline

- [ ] **Check D3D device initialization return values** [analysis]
  - D3DDevice_Create and setup functions may return stub values (0/-1)
  - Game may silently fail to create device, render targets, or swap chain
  - Look for D3DDevice_Create* in MAP and check their implementations

### Tier 1: Fix the Present path

- [ ] **Implement or stub missing D3D present functions** [xenia/dc3-decomp]
  - Once specific blocker identified, fix in the appropriate layer
  - Stub to return success in Xenia, or add to dc3-decomp if game-side

- [ ] **Verify first VdSwap call** [test]
  - Run with NullGPU IssueSwap logging
  - Confirm frame dimensions and frontbuffer pointer

### Tier 2: Activate idle threads + game progression

- [ ] **Investigate why Threads 1-5 never start** [analysis]
  - All 5 created with LR=0, SP at initial stack top
  - Likely worker threads waiting for signal from main thread
  - May activate once rendering pipeline completes

- [ ] **Check game state progression after first frame** [test]
  - Does game advance to loading screen?
  - Monitor for new function calls / thread activations

### Tier 1.5: Runtime Parity / Validation Infrastructure (high leverage)

- [x] **Add original-vs-decomp runtime parity gate** [xenia + test] ✓ Session 13
  - Scripted milestone/log comparison beyond NUI cutover gate
  - Track boot progression, recurring loop PCs, unresolved/no-op call patterns, and override hit counts
  - Implemented `tools/dc3_runtime_parity_gate.sh` (`hybrid` + `strict`)
  - Added explicit per-run manifest/symbol override env vars for clean-worktree parity validation
  - Goal: a stable regression signal for `dc3-decomp` / `jeff` changes

- [x] **Emit structured runtime telemetry (JSONL) for DC3 bring-up** [xenia] ✓ Session 13
  - Guest override hits
  - no-op stub hits / unresolvable calls
  - hot loop PCs / repeated callsites
  - Implemented cvar-gated JSONL telemetry (`dc3_runtime_telemetry_*`)
  - Use for original vs decomp diffing and prioritization

- [x] **Add telemetry diff ranking tool (JSONL -> blockers)** [xenia] ✓ Session 15
  - Implemented `tools/dc3_runtime_telemetry_diff.py`
  - Ranks decomp-vs-original deltas for override hits, unresolved stubs, and hot-loop PCs
  - Tolerates partial/crashed runs (missing `dc3_summary`) and still emits useful diffs

- [x] **Add guest crash/disasm helper (symbolized `PC/LR/CTR`)** [xenia] ✓ Session 21
  - Implemented `tools/dc3_guest_disasm.py`
  - Supports `--xenia-log` crash tuple extraction and XEX/PE/raw image inputs
  - Used by parity/trace tooling for postmortem artifacts

- [x] **Auto-triage common DC3 crash signatures** [xenia] ✓ Session 21
  - Implemented `tools/dc3_crash_signature_triage.py`
  - Labels invalid-SP / stack-underflow-prologue / trap-loop patterns from headless logs
  - Wired into parity gate artifact output (`orig` + `decomp`)

- [x] **Trace-on-break headless workflow wrapper** [xenia] ✓ Session 21
  - Implemented `tools/dc3_trace_on_break.sh`
  - Standardizes `--break_on_instruction` runs with telemetry + postmortem disasm outputs

- [x] **Milestone contract verdict + CRT impact triage in parity gate** [xenia] ✓ Session 21
  - Parity gate now prints milestone `PASS/WARN/FAIL` verdict (configurable policy)
  - Adds CRT-vs-milestone comparison summary to support constructor-impact prioritization

- [~] **GDB RSP Phase A protocol groundwork** [xenia] (in progress, Session 21)
  - Added `tools/dc3_gdb_rsp_mvp_mock.py` (crash-snapshot-backed mock server)
  - Added `tools/dc3_gdb_rsp_snapshot_bridge.sh` (one-command snapshot->RSP mock->GDB attach workflow)
  - Added Xenia-side structured crash snapshot output (`--dc3_crash_snapshot_path`) for tool-friendly postmortem inputs
  - Added Linux `xenia-headless` in-process RSP MVP listener (`--dc3_gdb_rsp_stub`) with Phase-A packet subset wired to `cpu::Processor` debugger APIs (Session 22)
  - Live smoke validated (Session 22): real `powerpc-none-eabi-gdb` attach + register snapshot fallback + guest memory read + detach on in-process headless stub
  - Current limit: headless build has no stack walker, so live pause/step/software breakpoints are disabled in fallback mode
  - Next: validate stack-walker-enabled `Pause`/`c`/`s`/`Z0` flow in a build/config with debugger pause support, then move the packet engine out of headless-only code into reusable Xenia-side guest-stub plumbing

- [ ] **Harden relink-sensitive DC3 stopgaps / probes** [xenia]
  - Replace or resolver-back the remaining hardcoded global addresses in `dc3_hack_pack.cc` where practical (example: `gConditional` sentinel currently requires fresh `default.map` refresh after relinks)
  - Keep invasive `ReadCacheStream` step override off by default (done) and split it into safer sub-modes if deeper DTB debugging is needed (`safe state log` vs `extra ReadImpl/Seek` perturbing probe)
  - Current restored RCS probe uses invasive `BufStream::ReadImpl/SeekImpl` overrides; investigate a lower-perturbation DTB probe path that preserves guest checksum-validator updates
  - Expand DTB probe coverage / diagnostics for pre-`ReadCacheStream` failures (current RCS probe may show zero hits when the crash occurs before `ReadCacheStream`; breakpoint check at `0x83116664` is the current reachability test)
  - Document any future relink-sensitive globals in `DEBUGGING_TIPS.md` with fresh-map lookup steps
  - Restore patch-manifest CRT sentinel freshness/validation so the CRT sanitizer can trust manifest values again (current recovery path uses map-synced constants when manifest is stale)
  - Replace duplicate-name-only hack-pack stub manifest resolution with a duplicate-safe identity scheme (current resolver now retries fallback on invalid remap, but collisions still occur for names like `XTLGetLanguage` / `XGetLocale`)
  - Replace temporary hardcoded MemMgr assert bypass addresses with manifest/symbol-backed resolution if the bypass remains needed for debugging
  - `FindArray` `log_only` now exists as an emulated probe mode (logs caller LR + symbol + hit/miss); keep improving it for symbol-corruption forensics (for example, decode/dump candidate symbol-table entries when `sym=<bin:...>`)
  - Keep CRT formatter bridges (`_output_l` / `_woutput_l`) pinned to verified map-synced addresses unless the manifest gains a duplicate-safe symbol identity scheme (generic name remaps can target unrelated implementations)
  - Investigate `Symbol` corruption in `Rnd::SetupFont`:
    - `SystemConfig("rnd","font")` second key captured as binary symbol at `LR=0x83516738` (`sym=<bin:83 0A FA 80 ...>`)
    - first verify decomp build freshness / literal sanity (current evidence points at stale `build/373307D9/obj/system/rndobj/Rnd.obj`; `SetupFont` ctor2/arg1 literal `0x82053BF8` is `"rnd"` as expected, but ctor1/arg2 literal `0x82027684` is non-string data instead of `"font"`)
    - only continue `Symbol::Symbol(const char*)` / string-table/hash corruption debugging if the linked `SetupFont` literals are confirmed sane after rebuild/relink
  - Investigate `Mat` / `MetaMaterial` instantiation failures (`Couldn't instantiate class Mat`, `MetaMaterial`) after the `SetupFont` crash fix:
    - `SystemConfig("objects","Mat")` and `("objects","MetaMaterial")` now probe as successful in `log_only` runs, so treat factory registration/init as a likely separate issue unless new evidence says otherwise
    - `setupfont_fix` runs also show `sFactories` map header populated and cached `RndMat`/`MetaMaterial` class symbols sane at fail time; continue by investigating factory function return paths / allocator failures, not just registration presence
  - ~~Investigate `String::reserve` crash after `setupfont_fix`~~ **ROOT-CAUSED (Session 32)**:
    - `PC=0x82A5BC48` (`String::reserve`) crash was caused by `MemAlloc` returning stack garbage (`0xFFFFFFFF`) when heap is exhausted and the `memmgr_assert_nop_bypass` lets `MemAlloc` continue past its assertion with uninitialized `FreeBlockInfo`
    - pool bucket 5 (96-byte slots) was genuinely exhausted: 241/241 nodes, 12 chunks, `freeList=0x0`
    - `MemOrPoolAlloc` probe (`--dc3_debug_mempool_alloc_probe`) captures and sanitizes invalid returns
    - **new blocker**: after sanitization, runtime enters tight SIGSEGV loop at `0x82924998` (`StringTable::UsedSize`) — likely downstream of heap exhaustion / `Mat.cpp:153` assert about `dir`
  - **Investigate heap exhaustion / `MemInit` configuration** [xenia]:
    - `MemAlloc` assert at `0x83446A24` fires because the main heap cannot allocate a 51KB pool chunk
    - either `MemInit` was configured with too-small heap (bad `SystemConfig("mem")` values), or the `MemInit line 690` nop is causing underinitialized heap state
    - check whether disabling the `MemInit` assert bypass fixes the heap or just moves the crash earlier
    - if heap is properly sized but exhausted, investigate allocation leak patterns

### Tier 2: Reduce unresolved symbols (high leverage)

- [x] **Categorize all unresolved symbols** [dc3-decomp, Agent D] ✓ Session 10
  - 867 unique: 334 non-string + 533 string literals
  - P0: 26 CRT constructors (11 complex, 15 ChunkID ints)
  - P1: 195 `lbl_` labels, P2: 48 SEH handlers, P3: 19 merged, P4: 18 third-party
  - See `docs/dc3-boot/agent_d_symbol_categories.md`

- [x] **Analyze string literal COMDAT failure** [jeff, Agent C] ✓ Session 10
  - Root cause: jeff commit `cf01a80` + compiler hash mismatch
  - Fix: hash normalization in xex.rs (replace all `??_C@` hashes with `A`)
  - See `docs/dc3-boot/agent_c_comdat_analysis.md`

- [ ] **Fix COMDAT string extraction in jeff** [jeff]
  - Implement hash normalization fix identified by Agent C
  - Re-enable `.rdata` COMDAT extraction with vtable relocation protection
  - Target: resolve 533 `??_C@` string literal symbols

- [ ] **Fix 26 missing CRT constructor exports** [dc3-decomp/jeff]
  - 11 complex: TheMemcardMgr, ThePresenceMgr, TheVirtualKeyboard, gThreadAchievements,
    FilePath::sRoot, FilePath::sNull, gDataPointMgr, gWavMgr, gChecksumData, gEntries, gOverride
  - 15 simple: kListChunkID, kRiffChunkID, kMidiChunkID, etc.
  - Fix: export `??__E` symbols from asm .obj OR implement C++ initializers in decomp source
  - All have known correct MAP addresses (0x82A2E81C-0x82EE9D30)

- [ ] **Stub third-party library functions** [dc3-decomp]
  - libjpeg, curl, Ogg Vorbis, zlib -- ~18 missing symbols
  - Create stub .c files with no-op implementations
  - Add to build system

- [ ] **Fix lbl_ symbol exports** [dc3-decomp]
  - 195 `lbl_` assembly labels unresolved (clustered at 0x82F6xxxx, 0x830Exxxx)
  - Analyze: which are code vs data references
  - Fix splits.txt boundaries or add symbol exports where needed

### Tier 3: Stabilize xenia patches (quality of life)

- [x] **Automate MAP address extraction** [xenia, Agent E] ✓ Session 10
  - `tools/dc3_extract_addresses.py` validated: 70/70 symbols match
  - Generates C++ header with `constexpr` addresses
  - Production-ready, no fixes needed

- [ ] **Make CRT sanitizer threshold dynamic** [xenia]
  - Currently hardcoded kCodeStart = 0x822C0000
  - Should derive from PE section headers at runtime

- [x] **Commit and push xenia working tree** [xenia] ✓ Session 13
  - Merged DC3 headless debugging + NUI/XBC cutover work
  - Branch `headless-vulkan-linux` pushed to `origin`

- [~] **Extract non-NUI DC3 hacks into a title hack pack/module** [xenia] (in progress)
  - Extracted (stable): CRT/imports/debug/decomp stopgaps into `src/xenia/dc3_hack_pack.{h,cc}`
  - Completed second-pass extraction: `fake_kinect_data` skeleton injection + SkeletonUpdate binary patches now route via `ApplyDc3SkeletonHackPack(...)`
  - Keep NUI/XBC resolver path as the reference architecture
  - Goal: clearer ownership and easier hack retirement

- [x] **Create a hack retirement matrix (Xenia ↔ dc3-decomp/jeff)** [docs + xenia + decomp] ✓ Session 13 (initial scaffold)
  - For each workaround: reason, scope, current necessity, retirement trigger, owner
  - Initial matrix: `docs/dc3-boot/HACK_RETIREMENT_MATRIX.md`
  - Use this to prioritize decomp fixes that delete emulator hacks

- [~] **Promote patch manifest as canonical machine-readable contract** [dc3-decomp + xenia] (in progress)
  - Done: schema/version fields + `build_identity` block in emitter; parser schema/version validation + safe fallback on invalid manifests
  - Done: Xenia disables manifest target addresses on manifest/runtime fingerprint mismatch
  - Remaining: detect stale `.map` vs `.xex` pair mismatch (manifest may be schema-valid but semantically wrong)
  - `.map` remains for human investigation

### Tier 4: Post-boot progression (after CRT init works)

- [ ] **Handle CharacterProvider::Text() null vtable crash** [xenia/dc3-decomp]
  - Session 8 blocker, likely to recur after CRT init is fixed
  - Fix: construct missing global (TheGameData, etc.) or stub the call chain

- [ ] **Assess how far past main() the game gets** [test + observe]
  - App::Init, SystemConfig loading, resource loading
  - Each stage will likely hit new unresolved symbols
  - Iterative: fix crash, run, observe next crash, fix
